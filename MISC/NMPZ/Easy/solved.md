So now we have the location Sydney. Now I can have a look at the company branded sky scrapers. I identified 'myob' company building beside an ibis hotel. I can simply google Myob Sydney, and find the site that is opposite an ibis hotel.

We can see a sign stated 'atencion'. Googling tells me this is spanish, so I've already identified it's a spanish speaking country. I can see a monoment that resemables the Eiffel tower to the side. I search for Eiffel tower replicas located in Spain. Sure enough, there are whole articles detailing these replicas so i just had to go down the list *https://www.wonders-of-the-world.net/Eiffel-Tower/Repliques/Replicas-of-the-Eiffel-tower-in-Spain.php*.

From the japanese lettering (seen via 'JP' Post), I know we are in Japan. The building at the side has its name printed on the side. So I search 'Mita Garden hills' (seen on building) Japan. It is located near tokyo tower - another Eiffel replica! Some simple zooming around gets us the exact location.

We see another Eiffel Tower replica beside a retail park and cinema. I can't make out the lettering as the image is too blurry so i decide to move on instead of going through every Eiffel Tower replica in existance.
