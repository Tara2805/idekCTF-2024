# mr_drains
So we're dropped on a motorway in a city landscape. The van beside us has the text "MR Drains" painted on the side. So I search "mr drains plumbing" from the van seen

So now we have the location Sydney. Now I can have a look at the company branded sky scrapers. I identified 'myob' company building beside an ibis hotel. I can simply google Myob Sydney, and find the site that is opposite an ibis hotel.
